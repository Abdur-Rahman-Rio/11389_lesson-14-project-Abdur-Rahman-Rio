   <h2>
     Poverty
   </h2>
   <p>
    While most of us are fortunate enough to have access to clean running water, food, and to have shelter, many around the world and even in the United States are not. In fact, due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, the trend in decline in poverty for the last three decades has been reversed, and over four years of progress is all but destroyed. For the first time in two decades, the working poverty rate has increased. Moreover, inflation is also taking a heavy toll, and due to the war in Ukraine, some countries can no longer get the food import they used to, leading to another increase.
   </p>
   <h2>Hunger</h2>
   <p>
    However, on top of the poverty rate, also have a disturbing number of people who lack food, which has been increasing since 2015, and skyrocketed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the United Nations, 1 in 10 people are suffering from hunger, and 1 in 3 lack access to properly adequate food. As stated before, the war in Ukraine has only made things worse, as the country was a major exporter of some staple foods for many people, particularly those in less developed countries.
