  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We hope to create a website that is accessibility to everyone, so everyone can contribute to ending world poverty. Below is a table of some barriers that some of us face, and what the web developer of this site has done to address the issues.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
        <th>
           Barrier

        <td>
          Auditory
        </td>
        <td>
          Some content such as videos can pose a challenge if there are no subtitles or transcripts available.
        </td>
        <td>
          We made sure all of our content can be accessed through reading without sound.
        </td>

          Visual
        </td>
        <td>
          It can be hard to see colors that have a low color contrast, and smaller font can also be hard to read.
        </td>
        <td>
          We used an accessibility checker to make sure our color contrast passes the regulations.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
          Physical
        </td>

          A number of challenges can occur, such as unable to click small links and having a hard time with navigation menus.
        </td>
        <td>
          We made sure our site has a simple navigation, and that background for the links in the navigation menu change color.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>
          Cognitive/<br>Neurological

        <td>
          Complex menu layouts can create problems with navigation and long paragraphs without pictures.
        </td>
        <td>
          We made sure to include pictures and to make our navigation simple.
        </td>
